# Behind the Stream ðŸŽ¬: Analyzing Netflix's Catalogue



## **Introduction**
Netflix has transformed the way audiences consume content by pioneering the streaming industry, becoming a global leader in on-demand entertainment. This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Netflix's catalogue to uncover key trends and insights through interactive dashboards.

The main objectives of this project include:
- Determining the most represented genres on the platform.
- Examining Netflix's availability across countries.

## **Dataset**
This project uses the **Netflix Titles Dataset**, which includes information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix. Key columns in the dataset include:
- `title`: The name of the movie/TV show.
- `type`: Whether the title is a movie or a TV show.
- `country`: The countries where the title is available.
- `release_year`: The year the title was released.
- `genre`: Genres associated with the title.
- `cast`: The actors involved in the title.
- `date_added`: The date the title was added to Netflix.

## **Data Processing**
### **Data Cleaning and Transformation in Power Query**
The dataset underwent significant cleaning and transformation steps in Power Query to prepare it for analysis:

1. **Importing and Initial Exploration**:
   - The dataset was loaded into Power Query for cleaning and transformation.
   - Columns were reviewed for inconsistencies, missing values, and incorrect data types.

2. **Handling the `cast` and `country` Columns**:
   - **`cast`**: The column contained multiple actors listed in a single cell. It was split into multiple columns, and only the **first three actors** were retained for analysis.
   - **`country`**: In cases where multiple countries were listed, only the **first country** was kept, assuming it as the primary country.

3. **Processing the `genre` Column**:
   - The table was duplicated to focus on genre analysis.
   - The **`genre`** column was split into multiple rows, with each genre occupying its own row.
   - Null values in this column were removed.
   - Only the columns **`Show_ID`** and **`country`** were retained in the new table.
   - A relationship was established between the original table and the new table using **`Show_ID`** as the key, ensuring proper cardinality.

4. **Removing Empty and Erroneous Values**:
   - Rows with missing or erroneous data were filtered out to ensure clean and reliable analysis.

5. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Columns were converted to their appropriate data types, such as dates, text, and numbers, to facilitate accurate visualizations.
